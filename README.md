# Learning React
Code dumpsite for my journey of learning React

### Creating a React App
- use this command
```
# do this once
npm install -g create-react-app

# then this everytime you want a new project
npx create-react-app <app name>
```
- if you are getting errors, try to clear the dependencies cache (or uninstall the create-react-app module)
```
npx clear-npx-cache
npm uninstall -g create-react-app
```
